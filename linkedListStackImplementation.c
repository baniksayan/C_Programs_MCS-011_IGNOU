//When a stack is implemented using arrays, it suffers from the basic limitation of an array â€“ that is, its size cannot be increased or decreased once it is declared. As a result, one ends up reserving either too much space or too less space for an array and in turn for a stack. This problem can be overcome if we implement a stack using a linked list. In the case of a linked stack, we shall push and pop nodes from one end of a linked list. The stack, as linked list is represented as a singly connected list. Each node in the linked list contains the data and a pointer that gives location of the next node in the list. following Program implements a stack using linked lists.

// Similarly, as we did in the implementation of stack using arrays, to know the working of this program, we executed it thrice and pushed 3 elements (10, 20, 30). Then we call the function display in the next run to see the elements in the stack.

// Explanation Initially, we defined a structure called node. Each node contains two portions, data and a pointer that keeps the address of the next node in the list. The Push function will insert a node at the front of the linked list, whereas pop function will delete the node from the front of the linked list. There is no need to declare the size of the stack in advance as we have done in the program where in we implemented the stack using arrays since we create nodes dynamically as well as delete them dynamically. The function display will print the elements of the stack.
